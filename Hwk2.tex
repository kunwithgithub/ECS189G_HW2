\section{lm Model}
\subsection{Movienum}
Movienum will be our first predictor. But directly using movienum 
in lm function does not seem very promising, because movienum 
itself is only IDs for different movies and logically does not 
directly affect users' rating. Instead, we use movienum to 
calculate average rating of each individual movie. Then, we define 
movies with average ratings greater than or equal to 4.0 as 
"best movies" and define movies with average ratings less than or 
equal to 3.5 as "worst movies". Below is the code we used to do 
this job:
\begin{verbatim}
  # transform movienum to factor
  mov_factor <- as.factor(u.big$movienum) 
  levels <- levels(mov_factor)
  mov <- matrix(0,nrow = length(levels),ncol = 3)
  for (i in 1:length(levels)) {
    # find all the rows concerning the same movie
    movX <- u.big[mov_factor == levels[i],]
    average_rate <- mean(movX$rating)
    
    mov[i,1] <- as.numeric(levels[i])
    if(average_rate >= 4.0)
      mov[i,2] <- 1
    if(average_rate <= 3.5)
      mov[i,3] <- 1
  }
  mov <- as.data.frame(mov)
  names(mov) <- c("movienum","best_movie","worst_movie")
  
  # merge it back to data frame u.big later
  u.big <- merge(u.big, mov, by = "movienum", all.x = TRUE)
\end{verbatim}

Why did we do this? It comes from the intuition that some movies 
are just better than others. Those movies of high quality should 
receive higher scores than those of low quality. If most users 
speak highly of a certain movie, it proves that this movie is of 
high quality and tends to receive higher scores from future users, 
and vice versa.

\subsection{Usernum}
Our second predictor will be usernum. The way that we used to 
approach usernum is very similar to what we did for movienum. We 
use usernum to calculate average rating given by each individual 
user. Then, we define users who give average ratings less than or 
equal to 3.0 as "tough person" and define those who give average 
ratings greater than or equal to 4.0 as "nice person". Below is the 
code we used:
\begin{verbatim}
  usr_factor <- as.factor(u.big$usernum)
  levels <- levels(usr_factor)
  usr <- matrix(0,nrow=length(levels),ncol = 3)
  for (i in 1:length(levels)) {
    usrX <- u.big[usr_factor == levels[i],]
    average_rate <- mean(usrX$rating)
    usr[i,1] <- as.numeric(levels[i])
    
    if(average_rate >= 4.0)
      usr[i,2] <- 1
    if(average_rate <= 3.0)
      usr[i,3] <- 1
  }
  usr <- as.data.frame(usr)
  names(usr) <- c("usernum","nice_person","tough_person")
  u.big <- merge(u.big, usr, by = "usernum", all.x = TRUE)
\end{verbatim}

We did this based on the assumption that some users are just 
harsher than others, and they tend to give relative low ratings for 
movies they have seen. Also, some users are just more lenient than 
the ordinary, and they tend to give relative high ratings for 
movies.

\subsection{Genres}
Different kinds of movies should affect their ratings. Our first 
attempt is to use all genres as predictors. Below is the result:

We can see from the above that not all genres has a great impact on
users' ratings. For example: the coefficient of "Action" movie is 
only $-0.0859$, meaning that whether a movie is action or not will
not affect people's ratings very much. Therefore, we could safely 
remove some genres from our predictors while preserving the 
accuracy of our predictions. Below are all the genres we 
included in our final lm model.

lm(formula = as.formula(indexToStr(u.big, predictors)), data = u.big.trn)

We found that even if we remove 6 different genres from our 
predictors, MAPE does not change.

\subsection{Occupations}
Our intuition to predicting ratings is based on factors that fundamentally represent the user's
personality. Some features we considered are age, usernum, and occupation. To elaborate on this,
we think that including usernum as a feature would let us know their rating based on how harshly
or leniently a user rates their movies, based on their user ID. 

\begin{figure}[ht!]
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{ratingxocc.png}
\caption{Average Rating vs. Occupation}
\end{center}
\end{figure}

Intuitively, occupation reflects a person's personality. We plotted 
the average rating given by each occupation. As shown in the plot, 
the ratings are not very uniform, which would probably make 
Occupation a good feature to predict ratings. 
Our first attempt is simply using all occupations as our 
predictors. Here is the result.

Comparing this with Figure 1, we believe that ratings given by 
people of different occupations are around the same. But there are
two special cases. First, healthcare workers tend to give relative
low ratings compared to other occupations. Second, people whose 
occupation is none tend to give relative high ratings. Therefore,
the only two occupations we used as predictors are "healthcare" and
"none." Below is the result.

We could see that using these two occupations as our predictors 
actually improves our result.
 
Since age likely affects
the kind of occupation a person has, we decided to use the interaction term `age` and `occ` to predicting
ratings. The MAPE obtained from this set of features is 0.8752.

\subsection{ZIP Code}
ZIP codes reflect the location of users. It is potentially reflect
the personality of users, which further affect their ratings. 
Therefore, we take first two digits of ZIP codes, make it into 
factor variables, call factorToDummies function to convert it 
into dummy variables, and use all of them as our predictors. The result MAPE is 0.8978.

\subsection{Interaction Terms}
We also explore some interaction terms. We think people of 
different occupations might have different preference for movies.
For example, artists might prefer drama and musical, and technician
might prefer science fiction. Therefoer, using interaction terms 
of occupations and genres might help us improve the accuracy of 
our prediction.

\clearpage
The first interaction term we include is $\textbf{executive} * \textbf{comedy}$.
\begin{figure}[ht!]
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{comedy_occ.png}
\caption{Average Rating for Comedy vs. Occupations}
\end{center}
\end{figure}

From the above plot, we find that executives tend to give low 
ratings for comedy. Therefore, we want to use $\textbf{executive} * \textbf{comedy}$ as 
one of interaction terms in our lm model.

The second interaction term we include is $\textbf{student} * \textbf{mystery}$.
\begin{figure}[ht!]
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{mystrey_student.png}
\caption{Average Rating for Mystery vs. Occupations}
\end{center}
\end{figure}

From the above plot, we find that students tend to give low 
ratings for mystery. Therefore, we want to use $\textbf{student} * \textbf{mystery}$ as one of interaction terms in our lm model.
\clearpage

Other interaction terms we include are $\textbf{artist} * \textbf{Sci-Fi}$ and $\textbf{writer} * \textbf{Sci-Fi}$.
\begin{figure}[ht!]
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{sci_fi.png}
\caption{Average Rating for Sci-Fi vs. Occupations}
\end{center}
\end{figure}
We figure out that artists give rather high ratings for science 
ficiton, while writers give rather low ratings for it. We expect
there will be a positive coefficient for $\textbf{artist} * \textbf{Sci-Fi}$ and a negative coefficient for $\textbf{writer} * \textbf{Sci-Fi}$.

The last interaction term we included is $\textbf{writer} * \textbf{Action}$.
\begin{figure}[ht!]
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{action.png}
\caption{Average Rating for Action Movies vs. Occupations}
\end{center}
\end{figure}
Writers tend to give quite low ratings for action movies. 
Therefore, using $\textbf{writer} * \textbf{Action}$ as interaction
term is highly likely to improve the accuracy of lm model.

\subsection{Final lm Model}
Our final model for lm will use usernum, movienum, some genres of 
movies, occupation of healthcare, occupation of none, all ZIP 
codes, and the above interaction terms as predictors. Below is the 
result of lm model. MAPE of this final model is 0.7416.

\section{nmf model}
\tab{}In the nmf model, we input usernum, movienum, and rating as the input of the training set of the recosystem()'s \$train() function.
\\*
\tab{}We ran the \$train() function once with default tuning parameters beside the nmf = TRUE because we want the function to use nmf method instead of svd, and we want to see the MAPE() result with default settings so we could have a standard later on when we tune it.
\\*
\tab{}The MAPE() result for the nmf model is 0.7329318, which is not really "bad" consider it is already lower than our best lm model.
\\*
\tab{}To inrease the accuracy, we first tried different \textbf{\underline{dim}}, and see how the MAPE() result changed. We noticed that there would be an "optimal" number within a region, like a "local" optimize point so the result would be the lowest. Considering the rule of thumb that $p << \sqrt{n}$, we choose dim=25, as it improve the MAPE() result for 0.01 compared to the default one.
\\*
\tab{}Then, we tried different \textbf{\underline{niter}} since we discover the accuracy will increase as this parameter increase. But there is a asymptomatic ceiling for this parameter, which the improvement would not be noticeable or even could decrease the accuracy if we keep increasing it. Thus, after we played around with it, we set niter=80 as it improve our result for another 0.01.
\\*
\tab{}At last, our final nmf model's MAPE() result is 0.7139921 which improve by 0.02 compares to the original model with default tuning parameter.
\\*
\tab{}In addition, we also tried plugging in different predictors to user\_index and item\_index to see what happens to the predicting results. But the accuracy of the combinations we have tested are all worse than the original one with usernum and movienum. We think that since we are predicting existing users and movies, movienum and usernum should be the most dominant predictor in this model. Thus, we still stick to our previous best model.
\\*
\tab{}p.s. After Monday's lecture that discussed about the letter, we've done some search on the learning rate which is the step size between each iteration. We believe that the lrate parameter has the potential to further improve our model's accuracy. Indeed, it turns out that the MAPE() result become 0.7130311. which is 0.001 better than our previous model with lrate default to 0.1.
